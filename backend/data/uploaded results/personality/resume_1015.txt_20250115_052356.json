  "raw_text": "         SALES       Summary     When thinking of the timeline of my career, numerous bullet points come to mind.  Whether it be a skill or achievement that I can bring to the table,  there is one common denominator that all of these personal traits fall under: Teamwork.  Regardless of what job I may have had in the past, whether it be music education, recruiting, or sales, understanding that I am  existing within/leading a team allows me to clearly understand the task at hand. Communication is the number one element to a successful team.  A prolonged lack of communication can manifest itself into a negative environment, and it has been my number one priority to make sure everyone involved is on the same page.       Highlights          6+ years of B2B sales experience.  MS Office proficiency  Team building expert  Proven sales track record  Detail-oriented  Sales management      Sales  Purchasing  Quotations  Accounts receivable  Customer service  CAD experience            Accomplishments     Handled the highest volume account for current employer  Developed profitable sales strategy with new product for longtime customer   Project Management \u00a0   Supervised project production efforts to ensure projects were completed to company standards, on time and within budget constraints.         Experience      Sales   01/2007   to   02/2016     Company Name   City  ,   State       Initially hired as warehouse manager.  Oversaw receiving inventory into stock, maintaining stock, as well as pulling and shipping orders as needed.  Primarily used UPS Worldship for ground and LTL packages/pallets.  Promoted to inside sales position in 2010 In charge of DAR's largest contracted customer.  Main responsibilities involve processing large stock orders which pulled inventory from three different locations as well as drop ship orders.  Responsible for replenishing stock as needed.  Large customer service portion involved with this account.  Fielded technical and specification questions through conference calls between our company's customer as well as the end user customer.  Coordinated inspections for return items that were either defective, incorrectly supplied or did not meet the customer's needs.  Purchasing, sales, customer service as well as quotations all fall under the job description of an inside sales representative at DAR since it is a small family owned business.  Strictly defined roles are not a part of this job.  Various situations required different people to take on various responsibilities which is where communication between all stages of an order is pivotal to success.  The quotation process would be the most technical aspect of my time at D.A.R.  Calculating yields on material needed, required amount of labor (what type of labor) as well as the appropriate mark-up for any given product required constant communication between myself and the employees working the fabrication shop.  My greatest feeling of satisfaction came from quoting something never done by the company before and having that turn into an actual order.  Acquired new business for a longtime customer through competitive quotes and quick lead times for orders.  A close attention to inventory management resulted in quick lead times by making sure stock was available for custom items that customer started to purchase.  Every aspect of training for the inside sales position at D.A.R. was on the job. This gives me great confidence to branch out into other industries if so given the chance.
