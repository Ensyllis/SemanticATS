Leadership Capable but Technically Focused:\n- Has led teams (job search engine project)\n- More comfortable with technical aspects than people management\n- Strong preference for structured environments\n\n5. Problem-Solver:\n- Mathematics background suggests analytical thinking\n- Experience in optimization and troubleshooting\n- Focus on efficiency and system improvements\n\n6. Quietly Ambitious:\n- Steady progression in responsibilities\n- Continuous skill acquisition\n- Balance of independent work and team collaboration\n\n7.
