When marketing doesn't\nfeel like marketing, and people organically connect to your message, you've birthed a movement.  Gone are the days of the 1950's where individualism rooted in autonomy allowed one to be labeled as the \"lone\nwolf\" and heroically conquer the \"Corporate Ladder\".  Similarly, business entities cannot survive the current\nglobalized, hyper-competitive market through, what I call, \"Corporate -Isolationism\".  A business, whether a\nstart-up or an established titan of industry, must always find relevant ways connect and communicate with\nits audience.  My interest in business started when my friend's step-father told me \"The only road to success is the one\nyou build through work and creativity\".  This statement has birthed a passion and drive to not only understand\nhuman behavior in what motivates one to buy, but also the mechanics behind product positioning.  What about\nthe product makes it appealing.  How can a business increase delivery efficiency.  How does a business drive\nup profit margins while driving down production costs?\nIn conclusion, between my experience in accounting, marketing research, marketing strategy, product\npositioning, market communication, and public relations has led me to believe two key things.  First, individual's\ndesire to buy hinges on the appealing presentation.  It has to be palatable to all five senses within 30 seconds\nor less.  Second, the product must serve a customer's need longer than the next fade of products.  In other\nwords, the product must withstand a competitor's product in offering versatile utility and adaptability options\nto every customer.  It is my hope that my communication skills along with my experience in marketing, sales, and accounting will\nassist in your company's profitability in product positioning.
