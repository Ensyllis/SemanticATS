Their journey began with a strong educational foundation in Marketing Management from Assumption University in Bangkok, setting the stage for what would become a fascinating career in social media and digital advertising.\n\nStarting as a Business Development Consultant at Oracle in early 2011, they cut their teeth consulting with C-level executives and promoting technology solutions. However, their true calling emerged when they joined Vserv.mobi as a Sales Lead in August 2011. There, they managed major accounts like Unilever and OMD, working toward ambitious revenue targets of US$200K while developing a knack for building and maintaining crucial client relationships.\n\nTheir success led to a promotion to Senior Sales Manager at Vserv.mobi in 2014, where they continued to refine their skills in pipeline management and client relations. The big break came in 2015 when they stepped into their current role managing Komli's entire social media business across Thailand.\n\nToday, they're the face of Komli's social media offerings, working with both brand and performance advertisers across the region. Their role is multifaceted - from executing platform demonstrations and signing long-term contracts to organizing client training sessions. They've become particularly adept at leveraging social advertising platforms like Facebook and Twitter, while also mastering Komli's proprietary technology offerings.\n\nWhat makes them stand out is their comprehensive skill set - they're not just a sales professional, but a mentor, a relationship builder, and a problem solver. Their expertise spans technical account management, client orientation, and strategic business planning. They've proven themselves particularly effective at maintaining client relationships through deep understanding of marketing goals and face-to-face interactions.\n\nIn essence, they've evolved from a business development consultant to become a well-rounded social media sales expert who can not only meet quarterly targets but also ensure the professional growth of their team while maintaining strong client relationships across Thailand's digital advertising landscape.",
