  "story": "Here's that resume rewritten as a story:\n\nThe tale begins with an ambitious Game Designer who found their calling in the world of virtual reality. Armed with exceptional modeling skills and an eye for detail, they set out to make their mark in the gaming industry.\n\nTheir journey started in 2014 at Sanford Brown, where they immersed themselves in Fine Art and Game Design, mastering advanced modeling, animation, and world-building. Like an artist with a digital canvas, they learned to wield tools like Maya, Photoshop, and various 3D modeling software with precision.\n\nIn 2015, they cut their teeth as a Game Tester, meticulously examining games for flaws and collaborating with international teams across language barriers. This experience taught them the importance of quality and attention to detail in game development.\n\nThe following year marked their evolution into a VR Designer, where they truly found their stride. At their company, they became a master of multiple trades - crafting 3D models, perfecting textures, orchestrating lighting, and designing sound for both Unity 5 and Unreal Engine 4. They even shared their knowledge as a Teaching Assistant for Boeing's Game Development course at Chronos Global Academy, while also handling the marketing and sales of VR titles on Steam and Vive-port.\n\nThroughout their career, they've maintained an interesting side interest in cannabis, developing expertise in distinguishing between various strains - though this seems somewhat disconnected from their professional journey in game design.\n\nTheir story continues as they seek new challenges to further develop their impressive skillset in the ever-evolving world of virtual reality and game development.\n\n(Note: I maintained the cannabis-related information since it was in the original resume, though it seems rather unconventional for a professional resume!)",
