  "story": "Here's the resume rewritten as a narrative story:\n\nThis is the story of a media professional who began their journey at Temple University, graduating with a BA in Broadcasting & Mass Media in 2010. Their career started in 2013 as a Development Assistant, where they cut their teeth working with research teams and handling complex analysis software like comScore and Nielsen. It wasn't long before they transitioned to working with national and regional Direct Response clients.\n\nBy late 2013, they had evolved into a Digital Media Analyst, taking on the role of Digital Point of Contact for key accounts. They became proficient in implementing tagging strategies and building dashboard reports to measure campaign success. Their career continued to progress as they moved into a Digital Media Strategist position in early 2015, where they mastered the art of integrating various digital media channels and overseeing the buying process from start to finish.\n\nMid-2015 saw them step up as a Media Planner, managing accounts worth over $10 million in media budget. They not only developed innovative media recommendations but also took on a mentoring role, training Assistant Planners in the fundamentals of the industry.\n\nTheir expertise in programmatic buying became evident when they became a Manager in 2016, executing and optimizing online media campaigns through Demand Side Platforms. This led to their current role as a Programmatic Media Supervisor, where they've been since 2017. Now, they lead a team of Programmatic Associates and Managers across five major pieces of agency business, driving innovation and automation in media planning while building strategic relationships across the programmatic landscape.\n\nThroughout their career journey, they've maintained a focus on data-driven decision making, client relationship management, and staying at the forefront of media technology. Their progression from research assistant to team supervisor shows a consistent pattern of growth and adaptation in the ever-evolving world of digital media.",
