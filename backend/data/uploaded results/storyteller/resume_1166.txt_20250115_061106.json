After earning their Bachelor's in Computer and Information Sciences from Alabama A&M University, they began their career as a Project Lead in 1999, where they cut their teeth managing complex technical infrastructure and notably spearheaded an 18-month PBX to VoIP conversion project.\n\nTheir expertise in network architecture, system administration, and technical support caught attention, leading to their promotion as Project Manager in 2006. In this role, they demonstrated exceptional leadership by managing a team of 61 professionals and overseeing 12,000 output devices for the Army Corps of Engineers. They weren't just managing assets; they were crafting the policies and procedures that would become the backbone of the organization's operations.\n\nIn 2014, they elevated their career by becoming a Consultant, currently contracted with Community Health Systems (CHS) in Franklin, TN. Here, they've found their sweet spot combining technical expertise with healthcare technology, focusing on training and implementation of electronic health care software. They're known for their ability to bridge the gap between complex technology and practical clinical workflows, delivering both in-person and virtual training sessions that align with regulatory requirements.\n\nAlong the way, they enhanced their credentials with a Master's in Management from Florida Institute of Technology in 2003, which helped them develop a more strategic approach to technology implementation and business process improvement.\n\nWhat makes their story particularly compelling is how they've evolved from handling technical infrastructure to becoming a trusted advisor who helps organizations maximize their technology investments while ensuring user adoption and satisfaction. Their career arc shows a perfect blend of technical expertise, leadership skills, and business acumen, making them a valuable asset in today's technology-driven healthcare environment.\n\nTheir journey reflects someone who has consistently stayed ahead of technological changes while never losing sight of the human element in technology implementation and training.",
