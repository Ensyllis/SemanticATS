Their story began at Delaware State University, where they weren't just a student - they were a campus leader who managed to excel academically while being deeply involved in student life. From serving on the Executive Five Council to being crowned Mr. Sophomore and Mr. Omega Psi Phi, they demonstrated early leadership qualities that would shape their future career.\n\nAfter graduation, they embarked on a career in insurance, starting at ACE Group Insurance as a Foreign Casualty Production Underwriter. During this time, they participated in an Early Career Development program, where they made quite an impact - bringing in over $580,000 in bound premium. They didn't just process policies; they analyzed hundreds of risks across multiple insurance types and actively engaged with brokers to market ACE's products.\n\nTheir career then took an exciting turn toward marketing when they became Director of Marketing at InSpire Enterprise. Here, they managed a team of 10-15 staff members and oversaw marketing efforts across multiple brands, including InSpire Magazine and InSpire Film.
