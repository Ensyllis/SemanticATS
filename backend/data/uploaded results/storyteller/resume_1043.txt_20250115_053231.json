Their journey began in 2013 in a restaurant kitchen, where they started as a food prep worker. There, they discovered their knack for detail while preparing and plating desserts, managing inventory, and ensuring every dish met quality standards. They even helped cater special events, getting their first taste of customer interaction.\n\nHungry for more customer-facing experience, they moved to a caf\u00e9 position in 2014. This is where their people skills really began to shine. Even during the busiest rushes, they maintained their composure and friendly demeanor, handling customer concerns with empathy and grace. Their genuine approach to hospitality made them stand out among their peers.\n\nBy 2016, they were ready for their next challenge and stepped into retail as a Sales Associate. Here, they combined their people skills with business acumen, managing inventory control and helping customers find exactly what they needed. Their natural ability to educate customers about products while providing top-notch service helped build customer loyalty.\n\nAll while building this practical experience, they pursued their education, graduating from Manchester Central High School and continuing their studies in Sociology and Justice Studies at the University of New Hampshire. This academic background, combined with their hands-on experience, has shaped them into a well-rounded professional with strong communication skills, excellent customer service abilities, and sharp attention to detail.\n\nNow, they're looking to bring their energy, friendly demeanor, and proven track record of customer service excellence to a new opportunity where they can continue to grow and contribute as a valuable team player.",
