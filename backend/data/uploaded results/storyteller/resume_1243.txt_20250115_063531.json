One of their career highlights was managing media relations during the UN Global Compact's UNGA week, where they rubbed shoulders with global leaders like Al Gore and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, while coordinating with major media outlets such as Bloomberg, The Economist, and Reuters.\n\nTheir digital expertise shines through their work with various brands, including Honda South America and Napster, where they've masterfully wielded tools like Hootsuite, Sprout, and TrackMaven to boost social media engagement and brand presence. They've shown particular talent in cross-border e-commerce solutions, bridging gaps between Asia and the Americas through sophisticated ERP systems and data-driven strategies.\n\nCreative and tech-savvy, they're equally comfortable working with Adobe Creative Suite as they are managing complex PR campaigns or coordinating international teams.
