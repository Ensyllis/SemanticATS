Beginning their career in one of the most secure facilities in the nation, they served as a Security Police Superintendent at NORAD's Cheyenne Mountain AFS. There, they were entrusted with protecting vital national security interests, supervising security forces, and developing comprehensive security protocols that kept both personnel and sensitive information safe.\n\nTransitioning to civilian life, they took on the role of Branch Manager, where they applied their security expertise to the private sector, focusing on loss prevention and team management. Their natural leadership abilities shone through as they trained staff and implemented cost-control measures while managing payroll and staffing requirements.\n\nTheir career then took an entrepreneurial turn as a Business Development Representative, where they consistently generated between $1-3M in new business annually. During this time, they created a valuable sales training guide for new agents and honed their skills in database management and web content development.\n\nThe next chapter of their career focused on financial services, working in various roles including positions at Wells Fargo Equity Direct. They handled retirement planning, account maintenance, and customer service, always ensuring clients received thorough education about their financial options.\n\nTheir journey then led them to education, where they served as an Admissions Representative, helping prospective students navigate the enrollment process and addressing technical issues that might have hindered their educational journey.\n\nMost recently, they've found their niche as a Software Support Specialist, where they combine their technical acumen with their customer service expertise. In this role, they evaluate system compatibility, train users on new software, and ensure smooth technical operations.\n\nThroughout their career evolution, they've maintained a consistent thread of customer service excellence, problem-solving, and adaptive learning. Their educational foundation includes a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Regis University, completed in 2015, which has provided a solid framework for their diverse professional experiences.\n\nThis professional's story is one of continuous growth and adaptation, demonstrating how military precision and discipline can successfully translate into civilian leadership and technical expertise, all while maintaining a steadfast commitment to helping others succeed.",
