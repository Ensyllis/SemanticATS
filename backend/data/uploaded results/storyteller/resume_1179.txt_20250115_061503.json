Starting from humble beginnings as a Machinist and CNC Programmer from 2001 to 2009, they mastered the art of programming industrial machines for plumbing equipment, laying a foundation for their future in technology.\n\nDriven by ambition and a thirst for knowledge, they pursued multiple degrees at Limestone College, earning not one but three Bachelor of Science degrees - in Business Administration, Computer Science Software/Programming (both completed in 2011), and Computer Science/Information Technology (2013). Currently, they're furthering their education with a Master's in Information Technology at Virginia Tech.\n\nTheir career took a significant turn when they became a Database Administrator in December 2009. For over seven years, they worked with various database management systems, helping organizations modernize their data infrastructure by migrating information from legacy systems to new platforms.\n\nFrom March 2014 to May 2017, they elevated their career to a Consultant role, where they showcased their expertise in object-oriented design and programming. During this time, they developed Java-based billing systems and designed database systems for e-commerce websites using EJB platform. Their responsibilities included creating comprehensive test plans, documentation, and troubleshooting hardware issues, particularly with fault-tolerant hard drives.\n\nTheir technical arsenal is impressive, spanning multiple programming languages (Java, C++, C#, JavaScript), database technologies (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server), and various development tools and platforms. They're equally comfortable working with Microsoft Office Suite, networking technologies, and web development tools.\n\nWhat makes them stand out is not just their technical prowess, but their ability to communicate effectively and solve complex problems. They excel at identifying and resolving technical issues while maintaining strong relationships with end-users through their help desk support experience.\n\nThis is the story of a professional who evolved from programming machines to programming solutions, continuously adapting and growing in the ever-changing landscape of information technology.",
