While still a student, they dove headfirst into various internships, starting with a role managing billiard table sales where they helped modernize the company's online presence. They then gained valuable experience in data analysis and administrative work, before finding their true calling in digital marketing and communications.\n\nAs a journalist, they wrote engaging content for a news platform with 300,000 monthly readers, mastering the art of social media promotion along the way. Their marketing internships at various companies saw them working with CRM systems, developing client relationships, and crafting digital marketing campaigns. Perhaps most notably, they served as a Digital Marketing Intern where they managed corporate social media accounts and worked with web content management systems.\n\nTheir commitment to giving back is evident in their work as a Student Fundraising Ambassador for Vanderbilt, where they connected with alumni and raised funds for the university. They also worked as a tutor for student-athletes and volunteered teaching sports to special needs children.\n\nTheir technical toolkit is impressive, ranging from Microsoft Office suite to creative design software like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. They're also well-versed in web content management systems and social media management tools.\n\nTheir achievements paint a picture of a well-rounded individual: they won first place in a university marketing competition, earned academic honors as an Illinois State Scholar, and even dominated in both music (winning \"Battle of the Bands\" twice) and athletics (setting school records in track and field events).\n\nThis is someone who combines academic excellence with practical experience, creative talent with technical skills, and professional achievement with community service - a true multi-dimensional professional ready to make their mark in the digital marketing world.",
