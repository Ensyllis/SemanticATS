In those early years, they mastered the fundamentals - prepping ingredients, creating daily lunch specials, and learning the ins and outs of inventory management while helping with catered events.\n\nAfter a decade of honing their craft, they stepped up to become a Catering Chef in 2000. This new role allowed them to showcase their talents on a larger scale, managing entire catered events while ensuring impeccable food quality and coordinating complex logistics.
