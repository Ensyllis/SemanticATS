  "story": "Let me transform Tamantha Uebele's resume into a narrative story:\n\nFor nearly three decades, Tamantha Uebele has been weaving her expertise through the intricate fabric of home health and hospice care. Her journey began in 1991 as a Home Health Aide, where she worked directly with patients while mastering the transition from paper to electronic scheduling systems. This hands-on experience would later prove invaluable in her evolution as a healthcare technology expert.\n\nIn 2009, Tamantha's career took a pivotal turn when she became certified in Epic's Home Health Clinical system. Armed with both practical healthcare experience and technical knowledge, she embarked on a path that would make her a sought-after specialist in healthcare technology implementation.\n\nHer breakthrough moment came at ProHealth Care, where she wore multiple hats as Business Analyst, Principal Trainer, and Application Coordinator. Here, she orchestrated an end-to-end implementation of Epic's Home Health system, managing everything from initial setup to post-launch updates. This experience catapulted her into the world of consulting, where she began helping various healthcare organizations transform their operations.\n\nAt Providence Health & Services, Tamantha led a Community Connect Home Health implementation project, guiding the team through discovery, validation, and workflow design. Her expertise continued to grow at Northwest Community Hospital and Lahey Health, where she refined her skills in both technical analysis and instructional design.\n\nWhat sets Tamantha apart is her rare combination of deep clinical knowledge and technical expertise. She understands not just the nuts and bolts of Epic's systems, but also the real-world implications of healthcare regulations like OASIS and the complexities of physicians' orders and care plans. Her work has touched every version of Epic's Home Health system since 2009, and she's become particularly adept at bridging the gap between technical capabilities and practical healthcare needs.\n\nToday, as an Instructional Designer, Tamantha continues to shape the future of healthcare technology implementation. She creates comprehensive training materials, leads classroom instruction, and ensures smooth transitions for healthcare organizations adopting new systems. Her story is one of continuous evolution, from hands-on patient care to becoming a leader in healthcare technology implementation, always maintaining her focus on improving patient care through better systems and processes.\n\nThis narrative reflects how Tamantha's 28-year journey in healthcare has made her not just a technical expert, but a valuable bridge between healthcare practitioners and the technology they use to provide better patient care.",
