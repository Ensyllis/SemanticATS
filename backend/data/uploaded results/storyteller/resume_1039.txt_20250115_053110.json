  "story": "Let me turn this into a story about this candidate's professional journey:\n\nMeet a bilingual professional who speaks both English and Russian fluently, with a dash of French in their linguistic repertoire. After graduating from Edward R. Murrow High School in 2017, where they specialized in Communication Arts and Graphic/Advertising Design, they developed a strong foundation in multimedia and graphic design, mastering tools like Photoshop and Illustrator along the way.\n\nTheir career journey began in early 2014 as a waitress, where they balanced customer service with food preparation duties. Shortly after, they transitioned into an office secretary position, bringing order to chaos by digitizing paper records and providing reliable support to colleagues and management.\n\nSince April 2016, they've found their niche as a Sales Associate in the pet care industry. In this role, they've been putting their people skills to work, helping pet owners solve problems and find the perfect products for their furry friends. Their combination of technical skills, creative background, and customer service experience makes them particularly effective in this role.\n\nLooking ahead, they're interested in pursuing further education in advertising or graphic design, building upon their high school foundation in these fields. Their computer proficiency and multilingual abilities make them a versatile professional who can bridge communication gaps and tackle both creative and technical challenges.",
