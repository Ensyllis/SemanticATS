By 2008, they had advanced to become a Sous Chef, managing large-scale catering events for up to 500 people and leading a team of over 10 employees.\n\nTheir career took off as they progressed through various executive positions, including stints at a wine-oriented bistro, multiple restaurant/bar combinations, and even a brief role as a Culinary Arts instructor at a local high school. A notable highlight was their position as Sous Chef at a five-star luxury hotel, ranked #6 in Travel and Leisure World's Best Hotels in 2012.\n\nCurrently, since 2015, they're the Executive Chef at an intimate 40-60 seat restaurant and wine bar, where they've gained recognition through culinary competitions and media coverage, including features on ABC's Eye on LA and in the VC Star news.
