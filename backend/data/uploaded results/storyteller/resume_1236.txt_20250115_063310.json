  "story": "Let me transform this into a narrative story about this candidate's journey:\n\nFrom an early age, art was more than just a hobby - it was a calling. At Da Vinci Design High School, this budding artist began shaping their future, diving deep into project-based learning and even publishing a comic book with fellow students. Their talent didn't go unnoticed; they and their team claimed first place in the Junior Qualcomm Tricorder X-Prize Design competition, and they even had the opportunity to present their designs to Karten Design.\n\nThe natural next step was Loyola Marymount University, where they pursued a Bachelor's in Animation. During their time there, they collaborated with peers to create two 5-minute animated short films and designed and programmed two games, all while mastering industry-standard animation programs.\n\nTheir professional journey has been as diverse as it is interesting. In the summer of 2015, they took on a role as Canvassing Manager, advocating for LGBT+ workplace protections through the ACLU's Employment Non-Discrimination Act. The following summer, they shared their passion with the next generation as a Digital Arts Assistant Instructor, teaching everything from digital art and animation to coding and Minecraft-modding to students aged 5-18.\n\nCurrently, they serve as a Lead Artist, bringing the world of Dungeons & Dragons to life through custom character sprites, party screens, and 8-bit style backgrounds for an upcoming YouTube series. Their technical arsenal is impressive, with mastery over animation tools like Toon Boom Harmony and TV Paint, illustration software including Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and post-production programs such as After Effects and Final Cut Pro.\n\nThey're a fast learner with seven years of formal art training in both digital and traditional mediums, always eager to take on new challenges in design and character animation. Their journey from high school artist to professional animator showcases not just technical skill, but also versatility, creativity, and a passionate commitment to their craft.",
