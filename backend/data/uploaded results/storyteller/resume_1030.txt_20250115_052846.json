Their academic excellence earned them recognition as a National College Prep Scholar through Quest Bridge.\n\nTheir professional journey has been shaped by a deep commitment to their Native American heritage and community service. During the summer of 2017, they wore multiple hats - working as both a Sales Consultant and a Facilitator. As a Sales Consultant, they mastered the art of customer service, processing payments with a consistently positive attitude and maintaining a welcoming environment. Simultaneously, as a Facilitator, they shared their knowledge of Native American history and identity, mentoring high school students across various reservations.\n\nPrior to this, they gained valuable experience as an intern in 2015, where they educated Native communities about healthcare benefits and collaborated with fellow interns to achieve company objectives through community-based events.\n\nAt Columbia, they've emerged as a leader in the Native American community. They currently serve as a mentor in the Columbia Mentoring Initiative, guiding first-year students in the Indigenous family group.
