Here, they really began to shine, becoming an expert in foreign tax credits and handling complex international tax matters for over 70 foreign entities. A particular highlight was their participation in a transfer pricing task force that saved their company $20 million through improved cost-sharing calculations. They also championed a paperless initiative using OneNote that resulted in 80% cost savings.\n\nAfter establishing themselves as a subject matter expert, they moved into consulting work in 2015, where they could apply their extensive knowledge of international taxation, multi-state tax returns, and foreign source income analysis to help various clients.\n\nThroughout their career, they've maintained proficiency in essential tax and accounting software, including OneSource, CorpTax, Oracle, and PeopleSoft, while mastering Excel functions crucial for tax analysis.
