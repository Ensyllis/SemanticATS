  "story": "Let me transform this resume into a story:\n\nMeet a dynamic professional who has built their career around digital communication and data management. Their journey began in 2008 as a Medical Record Clerk, where they meticulously handled patient data, transferring information to the DOH website and reviewing over 500 records monthly for accuracy and compliance.\n\nAs they gained experience with data management, they transitioned into bookkeeping in 2013, where they mastered financial record-keeping using QuickBooks and general ledger systems. This role helped them develop a keen eye for detail and strong organizational skills.\n\nHowever, their true passion for digital communication began to emerge in late 2014 when they took on a Social Media Internship. During this three-month position, they dove into the world of website optimization and social media management, handling platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\nThis experience proved to be a stepping stone to their current role as a Social Media Coordinator, which they've held since September 2015. In this position, they've achieved impressive results, including a 47% growth in Pinterest followers through the creation of 45 quality boards. They maintain an active daily presence across social platforms and stay ahead of trends using tools like Alexa Rank and Google Analytics.\n\nTheir educational background in Public Affairs Communication from Baruch College-CUNY has provided a strong foundation for their work. They're proficient in various technical tools, including Microsoft Office Suite, Photoshop, WordPress, and eClinicalWorks software.\n\nBeyond their professional life, they're committed to community engagement, volunteering with organizations like Moma PS1 Warm Up Series and New York Cares. This blend of technical expertise, creative strategy, and community involvement makes them a well-rounded professional in the digital communication space.",
