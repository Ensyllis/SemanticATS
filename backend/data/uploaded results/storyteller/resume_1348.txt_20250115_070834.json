  "story": "Let me transform this resume into a coherent story:\n\nMeet a versatile engineer with a fascinating journey in robotics, automation, and aerospace. After completing their Bachelor's in Mechanical Design and Automation from Harbin Institute of Technology in China, they pursued a Master's in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, where their passion for combining mechanical engineering with cutting-edge technology truly flourished.\n\nTheir professional journey took an interesting turn when they started as a Research Assistant at Wharton School, diving into environmental economics projects. Here, they analyzed the European Emission Trading System, managing large-scale data using their programming expertise in Java, Python, and SQL.\n\nBut their true calling emerged in their current role as an R&D Product Development Engineer, where they're breaking new ground in aerospace technology. They're leading the development of a tail-sitter VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) unmanned aerial vehicle \u2013 essentially creating drones that can take off like helicopters but fly like planes. This role perfectly combines their expertise in aerodynamics, control systems, and mechanical manufacturing.\n\nTheir technical toolkit is impressive: they're fluent in multiple programming languages, including C, Python, and Java, and they're equally comfortable with mechanical design software like AutoCAD and Solidworks. They've built everything from self-balancing vehicles to hockey-playing robots (even securing 4th place in a Robockey competition at UPenn!), and they've mastered the art of 3D printing and laser cutting.\n\nWhat makes them stand out is their deep understanding of complex systems \u2013 from machine learning and computer vision to robotics and control systems. They've trained models to predict Twitter users' gender and implemented sophisticated algorithms for robot trajectory planning. Their work with quadrotors demonstrates their ability to handle complex dynamics and motion planning, while their experience with computer vision shows their capability in developing systems that can \"see\" and interpret their environment.\n\nThroughout their career, they've maintained a strong academic foundation while gaining hands-on experience, earning recognition in mathematical modeling competitions and continuously expanding their skill set. They're bilingual in English and Chinese, making them a valuable asset in our increasingly global tech landscape.\n\nThis is the story of an engineer who bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, consistently pushing the boundaries of what's possible in robotics and autonomous systems.",
