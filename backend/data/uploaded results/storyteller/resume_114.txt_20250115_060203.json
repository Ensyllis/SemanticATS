  "story": "Let me tell you the story of an ambitious digital artist and designer. After developing their creative foundation at the Community College of Baltimore County, they went on to earn their Bachelor's of Fine Arts in Digital Art & Design from Towson University in 2016.\n\nTheir journey in the design world began back in 2009 when they started taking on freelance projects, building a diverse client network and honing their skills. In 2013, they expanded their freelance work to include creating graphics for a local church, where they designed everything from pamphlets to banners, and even produced special effects for message series.\n\nA notable milestone came in 2014 when they won the Civic Engagement Cover Design competition, validating their growing expertise. That same year, they took on a role as a Graphic Designer and Promoter, where they combined creative design with promotional strategy.\n\nTheir career took another step forward in 2015 when they landed a position as a Multimedia Designer and Graphic Designer. There, they worked on branding projects and logo design, while also consulting with clients on poster designs for conferences and presentations.\n\nThroughout their career, they've mastered an impressive array of technical tools - from the entire Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, After Effects, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere, and Dreamweaver) to Sketchbook Pro. They're also proficient in HTML coding and various Microsoft applications.\n\nToday, they're a hardworking and focused artist seeking to channel their creativity and technical expertise into a full-time Graphic Designer position. Their work can be viewed at www.Artisterymedia.wix.com/creativeflow, where their portfolio showcases their journey from aspiring artist to accomplished designer.\n\nThis is the story of a creative professional who has consistently built upon their skills and experience, always pushing forward to create more impactful and meaningful design work.",
