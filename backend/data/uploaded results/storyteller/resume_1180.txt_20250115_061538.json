  "story": "Let me tell you the story of an ambitious consultant who's made quite a journey in the tech world. Born in Vijayanagaram, India, in 1992, this young professional has carved out an impressive career in Oracle manufacturing and distribution systems.\n\nHis story begins at Andhra University College of Engineering, where he studied Instrumentation Engineering and maintained a solid 3.4 GPA. During his college years, he wasn't just hitting the books - he helped establish the National Service Scheme and caught Microsoft's attention, becoming their Student Partner from 2010 to 2013. In this role, he spread the gospel of Microsoft technology to over 5,000 students and faculty, even creating a Windows store app called \"Lazy Chef.\" One of his proudest moments was presenting an app idea to then-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.\n\nWhile still in school, he took on an impressive side gig as a Manager at a startup from 2011 to 2013. He helped build the company from scratch to achieving annual revenue of 2 million rupees, training over 10,000 people in robotics, embedded systems, and app development. He even collaborated with Orient Blackswan on a textbook about presentation skills.\n\nBut his real passion emerged when he became a Consultant in 2013. For nearly three years, he implemented Oracle supply chain modules for a major Oil & Gas company, traveling to Australia, Canada, China, Romania, and the UK. He simplified complex processes, implemented EDI systems, and became an expert in training users worldwide.\n\nSince 2016, he's been continuing his consultancy work, focusing on Oracle implementations in North America. He's become particularly skilled at implementing E-Signatures and E-records systems, helping companies maintain quality data while reducing costs.\n\nWhen he's not transforming business processes, you might find him hiking, mountaineering, or planning his next international adventure. Fluent in English, Telugu, and Hindi, this Houston-based consultant brings a global perspective to his work, with a deep understanding of regional business ethics and cultures.\n\nHis story is one of continuous growth, from a student partner in India to a respected Oracle consultant who's implemented five full-cycle Oracle projects and counting. With more than six years of experience under his belt, he's known for being results-oriented, adaptable, and equally comfortable as both a team leader and team player.",
