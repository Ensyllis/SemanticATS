By 2015, she expanded her influence by becoming a swim instructor, where she not only taught swimming skills but also helped grow the program by bringing in over 20 new families.\n\nThe summer of 2017 marked a significant milestone when Abigail took on a customer service representative role. Here, she masterfully handled around 20 calls daily, managed membership contracts, and became a trusted key holder \u2013 demonstrating her reliability and growing professional maturity.\n\nHer retail experience as a sales associate further rounded out her skill set, where she created engaging shopping experiences and built strong relationships with repeat customers.
