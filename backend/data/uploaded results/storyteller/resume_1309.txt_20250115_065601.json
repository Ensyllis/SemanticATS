A defining moment came during the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, where they led the special edition of El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya, showcasing their ability to handle high-profile media events.\n\nThe late 1990s saw them stepping into executive roles, including a stint as Managing Editor at Diario 16, where they began to develop their expertise in digital transformation. This experience would prove invaluable as the media landscape began its seismic shift toward digital platforms.\n\nThe turn of the millennium marked their most significant professional chapter at ImpreMedia, where they rose to become Vice President of Content. Here, they oversaw both digital and print operations for the largest Hispanic news network in the U.S., reaching millions of readers across multiple platforms and publications.\n\nTheir expertise in digital transformation led them to found Mediathink Consultores, working with over a hundred media organizations across twenty countries. They've helped traditional media companies navigate the digital age, from Spain to Argentina, Brazil to Chile, earning recognition along the way - including 14 Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed Awards and accolades from the Society for News Design.\n\nAs a thought leader in the industry, they've shared their knowledge as a journalism professor and frequent speaker at major media events. They've co-authored books on journalism and digital media, and El Mundo newspaper recognized them as one of the most influential Spanish journalists on the Internet.\n\nMost recently, they've ventured into the cutting edge of media technology, consulting for Classora, a company specializing in semantic intelligence and artificial intelligence applications in digital media. They're also a founding partner of a digital marketing venture that expanded from Spain into Mexico.\n\nThroughout their career, they've maintained a consistent focus on innovation, digital transformation, and the future of media, while never losing sight of journalism's core values. Their bilingual capabilities and cross-cultural experience have made them a valuable bridge between Spanish-language and English-language media markets.\n\nThis is the story of a true media pioneer who has successfully navigated the industry's transformation from traditional print to the digital age, helping countless organizations adapt and thrive along the way.",
