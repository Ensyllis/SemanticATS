Here, they've combined their financial acumen with their growing passion for technology. They've led innovative projects like developing an inventory control metric system and streamlining electronic classroom management. Their role has evolved to include everything from managing AV technology and 3D printing support to coordinating multi-media services and managing student workers.\n\nWhile working, they've been pursuing an Associate of Applied Science degree in Digital Media at Northwest Vista College, adding formal education to their practical experience. Their technical toolkit has grown to include proficiency in Microsoft Office, QuickBooks Pro, Adobe Creative Cloud, and various web technologies.\n\nWhat makes their story particularly interesting is how they've maintained a consistent thread throughout their career: solving employer challenges with innovative solutions.
