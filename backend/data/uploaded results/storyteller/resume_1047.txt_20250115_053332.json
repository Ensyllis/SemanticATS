Their story begins in 2002 when they graduated from Heritage College of Beauty, shortly after completing high school at South Summit High School.\n\nTheir career took off as a manager at a salon, where they achieved remarkable success over six years. Under their leadership, the salon experienced a dramatic 150% increase in customer traffic and a 30% growth in sales, eventually becoming the top salon in Utah. They mastered the art of scheduling, goal-setting, inventory management, and team leadership during this time.\n\nIn 2014, they branched out as an Independent Contractor, where they honed their document review and computer skills, learning to be self-motivated in a fast-paced environment. Their journey continued as they took on roles of increasing responsibility, including a position as a sales associate and ads supervisor where they managed monthly promotions and held key holder responsibilities.\n\nCurrently working as a Sales Associate, they've become known for their enthusiastic personality and ability to create a positive atmosphere wherever they go. They strongly believe in the power of teamwork, often saying \"there is no 'I' in Team,\" and attributes their success to collaborative efforts with colleagues.\n\nThroughout their career, they've invested in their professional development, taking extended classes in interviewing, hiring, and goal-setting. They've also attended seminars focused on workplace problem-solving, covering everything from staffing to customer relations.\n\nWhat sets them apart is their natural ability to develop lasting professional relationships with clients and customers, combined with exceptional organizational and leadership skills.
