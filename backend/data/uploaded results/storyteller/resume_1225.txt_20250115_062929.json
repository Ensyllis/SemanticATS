Armed with expertise in PPC campaigns, social media marketing, and content creation, they've made significant waves in the digital marketing sphere.\n\nTheir story begins at the University of Missouri, where they earned their Bachelor's degree in Communication Business. This foundation would prove crucial for their future endeavors.\n\nThe real adventure began in 2014 when they cut their teeth as a Sales Associate, taking their first steps into digital marketing by managing social media accounts and helping boost brand awareness. But this was just the beginning.\n\nBy late 2014, they leveled up to become a Digital Media Buyer at their next company, where they truly spread their wings. Here, they juggled over 10 education clients' accounts, managing an impressive monthly budget of $500,000 across various platforms. Their keen eye for detail and strategic thinking consistently helped them hit client lead goals and CPI targets. They weren't just managing campaigns; they were crafting success stories.\n\nSince March 2016, they've been making magic happen at their current role as a Digital Media Buyer. They've become a master juggler, overseeing PPC campaigns across multiple search engines for three beauty school directory websites. Their crowning achievement? Skyrocketing their brand's Instagram following by an astounding 400% in just one month!\n\nTheir toolkit is impressive: from Google Adwords and Analytics to social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. They're equally comfortable with technical tools like Drupal, WordPress, and HTML, as they are with creative tasks like content writing and blogging.\n\nAlways staying ahead of the curve, they regularly attend marketing seminars and keep their finger on the pulse of industry trends.
