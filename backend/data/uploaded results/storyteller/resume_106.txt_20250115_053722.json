Born in India in 1982, this multilingual professional speaks five languages and has built a career helping organizations manage their most valuable asset: their people.\n\nAfter completing a B.COM in 2003 and an MBA in Human Resources in 2005, they embarked on their professional journey. Their career began as an HR Coordinator where they cut their teeth in the basics of human resources - from screening candidates and conducting interviews to managing employee records and handling exit formalities.\n\nA brief but significant stint as a Management Trainee in QA followed, where they gained valuable experience in ISO 9001:2000 standards and quality processes. This experience would later prove invaluable in their HR career.\n\nThe real turning point came with their role as an HR Assistant, where they spent over two years developing a comprehensive skill set. Here, they became a jack-of-all-trades in HR, managing everything from recruitment and performance management to training and development. They played a crucial role in implementing and running the HRIS system using Greytip software, and their eye for detail made them the go-to person for ISO documentation.\n\nTheir recruitment process was methodical - from sourcing candidates through job portals to conducting preliminary screenings and coordinating interviews. They didn't just fill positions; they ensured new employees had a smooth transition through carefully planned onboarding and induction programs.\n\nBeyond recruitment, they showed strong capabilities in performance management, helping design appraisal forms and conducting workshops. They maintained meticulous records of employee data, managed payroll processes, and kept track of training programs. Their ability to handle multiple responsibilities while maintaining confidentiality and professionalism made them an invaluable team member.\n\nToday, they offer a strong background in employee training and development, new hire orientations, and employee relations, backed by 3.5 years of qualitative experience in HR and administration. Their technical proficiency in MS Office suite, combined with their understanding of HRMS and HR policies, makes them a well-rounded HR professional.\n\nNow married and holding an EAD (Employment Authorization Document), they continue to bring their expertise and multicultural understanding to the HR field, ready to tackle new challenges and contribute to organizational success.\n\nThis is the story of not just an HR professional, but someone who has dedicated their career to bridging the gap between organizations and their employees, ensuring both grow together harmoniously.",
