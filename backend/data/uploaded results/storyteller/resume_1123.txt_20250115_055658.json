  "story": "Let me transform this resume into a coherent story:\n\nMeet a seasoned audit professional whose career spans over two decades of shaping and transforming internal audit departments across 19 countries. After serving in the U.S. Air Force's Strategic Air Command, where they managed the 7th Air Wing's financial operations at Carswell Air Force Base, their civilian career began to take flight.\n\nArmed with a Finance BBA from the University of Illinois and an MBA from the University of North Texas (where they graduated with honors), they embarked on their journey at PQ Corporation in 1996. As Senior Internal Auditor at the world's largest producer of sodium silicate, they built an Internal Audit Department from the ground up, managing operations across 19 foreign subsidiaries and 21 U.S. plants. They played a crucial role in modernizing the company's systems, helping transition from 40 separate computer systems to SAP.\n\nTheir expertise led them through various leadership roles at prominent companies, including a paper products manufacturer and Snap-On Tools, where they consistently improved audit processes and internal controls. At United Subcontractors, they managed audits across 61 locations, introducing innovative practices like adding a \"Best Practices\" section to audit reports. Their tenure at a major carbonated beverage company saw them reporting directly to the Board of Directors, managing comprehensive audit programs for a $600M operation.\n\nThroughout their career, they've weathered corporate restructuring, adapting to changes while maintaining their commitment to excellence. Since 2009, they've been working as an independent consultant, providing internal audit and control services to private firms across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nTheir professional dedication extends beyond their day job - they've been an active member of the Institute of Internal Auditors for 26 years, serving as President of the Philadelphia Chapter and holding various leadership positions. They've also given back to their community through a decade-long involvement with Big Brothers/Big Sisters and 12 years with the English-Speaking Union.\n\nAs a Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) since 1994, they continue to expand their expertise, currently pursuing their Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) certification. Their story is one of resilience, adaptability, and an unwavering commitment to improving internal audit practices across industries.",
