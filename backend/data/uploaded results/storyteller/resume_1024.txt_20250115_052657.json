  "story": "Here's the candidate's career story:\n\nFor over 25 years, this professional has been a driving force in the utility industry, evolving from a regional training coordinator to a respected sales supervisor. Their journey began in 1980 when they started facilitating workshops for new hires at their first company, armed with a Psychology degree from East Carolina University.\n\nThe early 1980s saw them quickly climbing the ladder, moving from residential energy sales to commercial power representation, where they broke barriers by becoming the first female non-engineer Industrial Power Representative in 1986. During this period, they consistently exceeded goals and developed innovative training materials for the company's call center.\n\nA significant career shift came in 2006 when they joined Piedmont Natural Gas. Though initially hired as a Residential Energy Specialist, their talent was quickly recognized, and within a month, they were promoted to Commercial Sales Representative. Their excellence in this role earned them the title of Commercial Sales Person of the Year in 2008, and they became one of only three employees to achieve LEED certification in 2009.\n\nBy 2012, their expertise led to a promotion to Sales Supervisor, where they managed a team of ten outside sales representatives. Their natural ability to mentor and train others, combined with their self-taught mastery of CRM systems, made them an invaluable asset to the company.\n\nCurrently serving as Sales Supervisor - Sales Effectiveness, they lead a virtual team of six Sales Support Coordinators and act as the CRM Product Owner. They've been instrumental in integrating Duke Gas Sales with Piedmont Natural Gas Sales, developing comprehensive training materials, and modernizing sales processes through digitization.\n\nThroughout their career, they've maintained active involvement in industry organizations, including the Charlotte Home Builders Association, where they served as a board member. Their expertise in Microsoft Dynamics CRM, combined with their certification as a facilitator for \"7 Habits of Highly Effective People,\" has made them a respected leader in sales effectiveness and team development.\n\nThis story is one of continuous growth, adaptability, and leadership, marked by consistent achievement and a commitment to improving both systems and people.",
