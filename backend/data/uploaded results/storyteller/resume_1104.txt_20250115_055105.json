  "story": "Let me transform this resume into a coherent story:\n\nThis is the story of a seasoned professional who has dedicated over 26 years to engineering and construction, starting from humble beginnings as a Project Designer and Shop Drawing Clerk in 1990. After graduating from Lehigh University with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, they began their journey, steadily climbing the ranks of the industry.\n\nThe early years were spent learning the ropes as a Project Engineer across various companies, where they honed their technical skills and began to understand the intricacies of project management. By 2002, their career took a significant turn when they stepped into a dual role as Project Manager/Project Engineer, where they achieved something remarkable - securing the first LEED-Platinum certification from the Green Building Council for an office renovation project. They also demonstrated their expertise in sustainable design by performing energy cost analysis for the Friends Center Renovation Project.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2014, they advanced to a Construction Manager position, where they led client conceptual developments and managed significant projects, including the Enon Field Conversion and the Grace Baptist Church Sanctuary A/C & Boiler Plant renovation. Their ability to mentor staff and manage complex projects became increasingly evident during this period.\n\nToday, they serve as a Sales Engineer, a role they've held since 2014. This position combines their technical expertise with client relations, where they develop proposals, manage construction projects from start to finish, and ensure all engineering work meets specifications and safety requirements. As a member of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), they stay connected with industry developments and best practices.\n\nTheir journey showcases a progression from technical roles to leadership positions, with a strong emphasis on sustainable design and project management. Throughout their career, they've maintained a consistent track record of delivering projects on time and within budget, while building strong relationships with clients across medical, research & development, commercial, educational, and industrial sectors.\n\nWhat stands out in their story is not just the technical expertise, but their ability to adapt and grow with the industry, embracing sustainable practices and maintaining excellent communication and organizational skills throughout their career journey.",
