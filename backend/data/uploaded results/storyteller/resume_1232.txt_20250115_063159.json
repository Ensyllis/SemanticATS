  "story": "Let me transform this resume into a narrative story:\n\nThe story begins with a dynamic leader who has spent decades shaping the digital media landscape. After earning his MBA from Virginia Commonwealth University, where he graduated magna cum laude, he embarked on a journey that would take him through some of the most influential companies in media and technology.\n\nIn the early 1990s, he cut his teeth as an MIS Manager before joining Capital One during its explosive growth phase. There, he played a crucial role in scaling the company from 700 to 22,000 employees, managing a massive infrastructure that supported millions of customers. He was like an orchestra conductor, harmonizing complex systems while slashing costs and improving efficiency.\n\nThe turn of the millennium brought new challenges as he ventured into the startup world, leading operations for a web hosting company. His talent for building reliable systems showed as he achieved near-perfect service availability and dramatically reduced server build times from days to mere hours.\n\nThe Disney chapter of his story was particularly exciting. As Vice President of Technical Operations, he transformed Disney's online presence, supporting properties like ESPN.com, ABCNEWS.com, and Disney.com. Under his leadership, these platforms grew to serve 85 million monthly visitors, making Disney a digital powerhouse.\n\nHis journey then led him to Playboy, where as SVP/CIO, he revolutionized their digital strategy. He created what he called a \"Digital Content Factory,\" launching video-on-demand services and modernizing Playboy.com with Web 2.0 features. It was like building a bridge between traditional media and the digital future.\n\nMore recently, he's been sharing his expertise as an independent contractor, helping various media companies navigate the complex waters of digital transformation. He's even expanded his influence internationally, developing a speaker forum called \"Business Hack Japan\" and working with JETRO to analyze the US digital distribution landscape.\n\nThroughout his career, he's been known for three things: driving innovation (like launching the pioneering ESPN Motion infrastructure), achieving operational excellence (consistently reducing costs while improving service quality), and building strong, lasting teams (maintaining impressive retention rates through thoughtful leadership).\n\nHis story is one of continuous adaptation and growth, always staying ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving digital media landscape. Whether it's managing massive infrastructure projects or leading digital transformations, he's shown an uncanny ability to bridge the gap between technology, business, and consumer needs.\n\nThis professional's journey exemplifies how traditional media has evolved into today's digital-first world, and he's been there every step of the way, helping to shape that transformation.",
