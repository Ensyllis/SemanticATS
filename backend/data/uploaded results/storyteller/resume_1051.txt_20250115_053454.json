  "story": "Let me rewrite this as a story of this person's career journey:\n\nMeet a versatile professional who has built their career from the ground up, primarily through hands-on experience in various service-oriented roles. Their journey began in 2009 when they started working as a handyman, mastering everything from window repairs to power washing and painting. For seven years, they tackled projects of all sizes, from fixing small screens to renovating entire basements.\n\nWhile maintaining their handyman business, they completed their high school education at Avondale High School in 2011. Pursuing further education, they studied Liberal Arts at both Clackamas Community College and Oakland Community College between 2013 and 2016, showing their commitment to personal growth.\n\nIn the spring of 2013, they branched out into lawn care, becoming proficient with various types of mowing equipment and tackling everything from basic lawn maintenance to sophisticated landscaping work. They mastered the art of garden maintenance and even handled snow removal during winter months.\n\nLater that year, they took on a position as a Sales Associate, where they honed their customer service skills. In this role, they focused on creating positive customer experiences while managing inventory and maintaining store organization. Their ability to lift heavy objects and their \"customer-first\" mentality made them particularly valuable in this position.\n\nThroughout their career, they've developed a reputation as a dependable, independent worker with strong communication skills and an impressive work ethic. They take pride in being a \"jack of all trades\" who can adapt to any situation and complete tasks efficiently and satisfactorily. Their diverse skill set and commitment to customer satisfaction have made them a valuable asset in every role they've undertaken.",
